## Introduction

When you've written a useful computer program and want to share it with other code, a crucial step is creating documentation that helps people understand what the code does, how it works, and how they can use it.

To share the programs you've written and help people use them, you will create a website that documents code.

### What you will make

This guide will teach you how to build a website for your project that automatically creates documentation for your Python programs.
