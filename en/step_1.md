## Introduction

When you've created a really useful project and you want to share it with other people, a crucial step is creating documentation that helps people understand what the code does, how it works, and how they can use it.

To share the code you've created and help people use it, you will create a website that documents your project.

### What you will make

This guide will teach you how to build a website for your project that automatically creates documentation for your Python code.
